v0.13:

o Can now optionally store encoded article segments in memory,
  instead of disk. This can improve performance and CPU usage in
  some cases. Set CACHE_LIMIT to a non zero value to enable.
  
  Hellanzb.CACHE_LIMIT = -1 # for an unlimited sized cache, or
  Hellanzb.CACHE_LIMIT = '100MB' # for a certain size

o Added SSL NNTP support: defineServer ssl=True. (patch
  submitted by Oscar H)

o Fixed the PostProcessor on Windows, which would produce the
  error:

  exceptions.ValueError: The usePTY parameter is not supported
                         on Windows.

o Fixed download problems on Windows, which would repeatedly
  produce errors such as:

  Archive segment: 2 does not have a valid CRC/yend line!

  (thanks Ryan van Barneveld)

o Fixed total archive time reported at the end of PostProcessing
  (downloadTime was tallied as 0)

o Fixed the Hellanzb.CATEGORIZE_DEST option: it was impossible to
  disable in v0.12

o Fixed PostProcessor handling of filenames containing double quotes

o Fixed the error message:

 exceptions.TypeError: errBack() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)

 occurring during failed newzbin download attempts (thanks mke & JJ2)

o Fixed the following error triggered after failed yenc CRC checks:

  File "hellanzb-0.12/Hellanzb/NZBLeecher/ArticleDecoder.py", line 685,
          in assembleNZBFile
      decodedSegmentFile = open(nzbSegment.getDestination(), 'rb')
  exceptions.IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 

  This issue was introduced in v0.11.


v0.12:

o Fixed v3.newzbin.com's DirectNZB support which was broken as of
  2007-02-18

o Improved downloader performance (CPU used and max download speed),
  especially for faster connections (such as over 40mb/s)

o Added support for libnotify notifications (patch submitted by Ruben
  Fonseca)

o No longer hiding exceptions; many were previously only shown in the
  debug log file

o Now printing the 'Transferred MB in Time at Speed (Archive)' message
  when the NZB is finished downloading, as opposed to when the archive
  has finished decoding. The difference could be significant on slower
  CPUs/ and or faster connections


v0.11:

o Fixed the error:
  ImportError: cannot import name daemonize
  with Twisted 2.5

o Added the Hellanzb.CATEGORIZE_DEST option. Enabling it saves archives
  into a sub directory of DEST_DIR named after their newzbin.com
  category (when queued using the enqueuenewzbin XMLRPC call); e.g. Apps,
  Movies, Music

o enqueuenewzbin now downloads gzipped newzbin.com NZBs via the new v3
  DirectNZB interface (Thanks DBordello and Thomas Hurst)

o Added support for fillservers (by priority)

o Now requeueing segments to other servers when they fail yDecode CRC
  checks

o Added optional support for converting MacBinary files

o Now properly parsing v3.newzbin.com NZB names

o Fixed the enqueuenewzbin error:
  exceptions.AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'b64encode'
  on Python 2.3

o No longer overwriting pre-existing files during rar extraction

o Fixed handling of NZB files with invalid segment number and bytes
  attributes

o Fixed .zip files in the QUEUE_DIR constantly being rescanned for NZBs

o Fixed a couple issues when antiIdle is disabled, including reconnection
  failures after connections are lost

o antiIdle disabled connections now avoid connecting at startup, and
  disconnect immediately when there is nothing left to download. i.e. they
  only are connected to the server when necessary. antiIdle disabled fill
  servers only connect when they have something to download

o Windows compatibility changes -- hellanzb has been reported to work on
  Windows as of the 0.11 changes (thanks hax)

v0.10:

o Multiple servers are now represented with different colors in the scroller
  output

o Added the ability to run an external handler script on an archive after
  post processing

o Now including duplicate files during par2 repair

o All filename paths in the config file now expand the "~" character to the
  user's home directory

o Added support for compressed (.zip) nzbs (thanks Freddie)

o Fixed the following IOError occurring on malformed NZBs that include multiple
<segment>s of the same segment number for a particular <file> (particularly
those NZBs created by newzleech.com):

IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/nzb/daemon.temp/download-tmp/hellanzb-tmp-archvie.file0172.segment0001_ENC'

o Added the ability to disconnect from the usenet server when idle (set
  antiIdle = 0)

o Fixed defineServer's bindTo option

o Added the enqueueurl RPC call (downloads the NZB at the specified URL)

o Better handling of slow NZB copies to the queue directory (won't queue the
  NZB until it's fully copied)

o Rars within rars are no longer deleted by the PostProcessor in some cases

o A few misc. lockup/stability related fixes


v0.9:

NZBLeecher:

o New feature: smartpar. hellanzb will now skip downloading extra par2/par1
files. If the post processor finds the archive requires more par data for
repair, hellanzb will automatically force the download of a minimal amount of
extra pars immediately

Daemon:
o New remote call: 'setrarpass'
(From hellanzb.py --help)

  setrarpass nzbid pass Set the rarPassword for the NZB with the specified ID

o Rar passwords are now saved in between CTRL-Cs.

o No longer leaving enqueuednewzbin/dequeued/cancelled NZBs in the TEMP_DIR

o Added the Hellanzb.UMASK option to force umask in daemon mode


v0.8:

Daemon:

o Fixed a nasty bug with the 'clear' RPC call -- it was deleting all files in
  the QUEUE_DIR (not just queued .nzb files). This bug prevented hellanzb from
  working nicely with shared QUEUE_DIRs (such as your web browser's download
  dir. This technique was even recommended in hellanzb's OS X install
  document), in fact, it could cause unwanted data loss (thanks yak)

o Quicker and more robust newzbin.com downloads (enqueuenewzbin call)

NZBLeecher:

o Added duplicate file detection/handling. Previously, NZB files containing
  duplicate files could cause the downloader to stop (at the end of an archive)
  under certain situations

o Fixed a decoder bug (causing corrupt downloads) affecting some uuencoded
  posts (and potentially some rare yEncoded posts)

o Fixed a yDecode specific decoder bug (causing corrupt downloads)

o Fixed a couple nasty bugs in the new downloader code (submitted by
  bobmckenzie, thanks!)

o Fixed "not1not2" KeyError exception in the multiple server pool automatic
  failover code (submitted by bobmckenzie, thanks again!)

o Fixed a bug causing the downloader to stop and the scroller to scroll
  excessive lines, after a certain situation where hellanzb was paused twice

o Correctly handling NZB files with out of order segments, previously this
  could cause corruption (thanks spinez)

o Fixed a bug causing the downloader to stop (at the end of an archive) after
  pausing/continuing with bandwidth throttling enabled (MAX_RATE set to
  a non zero value)


v0.7:

Daemon:

o Added the -D option to run the hellanzb queue daemon as an actual unix daemon
  process (forks and exits)

o Changed most of the RPC calls to return the output of a list or status
  call

o Added the enqueuenewzbin RPC call, downloads the NZB with the specified NZB ID
  from www.newzin.com, as long as you've included your newzbin login information
  in hellanzb.conf

o Changed the RPC list call to show NZB ids by default

o RPC status call now shows queued MB, ETA, NZB ids and the value of
  Hellanzb.MAX_RATE (if MAX_RATE is greater than 0)

o Invalid NZB files weren't being removed from the list of current downloads
  seen in the RPC status call (fixed)

o Fixed an odd case where a segment with no articleData could prevent the queue
  from continuing onto the next NZB. Also fixed a couple other possible bugs
  that might have caused hellanzb to deadlock in between NZBs

NZBLeecher:

o Optimized the downloader. Using approximately 2-4% less CPU on an Athlon
  2600+, FreeBSD 4.10

o Added automatic failover -- multiple server pools (defineServer lines) will
  now automatically requeue articles totally missing from their respective
  servers for redownloading on other server pools (Thanks very much
  Rubberneck!)

PostProcessor:

o Fixed the defunct process bug affecting some Linux distributions (thanks
  georgek)

o No longer using /bin/file for identifying rars. Running /bin/file via twisted
  seems to have triggered a twisted bug where it wouldn't allow the /bin/file
  process to exit cleanly (on some if not all platforms)

o Added assembly support for split .ts files, recognizes patterns such as:
    hello.001.TS                hi.0001.ts
    hello.002.TS                hi.0002.ts
                                hi.0003.ts

ArticleDecoder:

o Optimized the yDecoder. Benchmarks show it using approximately 6-8% less CPU
  on an Athlon XP 2600+, FreeBSD 4.10

o Added support for optionally yDecoding via the yenc python module (wraps a
  yDecoder written in C). This provides better performance than the stock
  yDecoder. Requires yenc-0.3, available from:
  http://www.hellanzb.com/hellanzb-content/yenc-0.3.tar.gz


v0.6:

Daemon:

o Added XMLRPC calls to control an already running hellanzb, similar to nzbq
  and related programs. hellanzb, when invoked with a 'remote-call', will send
  xmlrpc calls to the main hellanzb process:

(From hellanzb.py --help)

remote-calls (via XML-RPC):
  cancel                Cancel the current download and move the current NZB to
                        Hellanzb.TEMP_DIR
  clear                 Clear the current nzb queue. Specify True as the second
                        argument to clear anything currently downloading as
                        well (like the cancel call)
  continue              Continue downloading after being paused
  dequeue nzbid         Remove the NZB with specified ID from the queue
  down nzbid [shift]    Move the NZB with the specified ID down in the queue.
                        The optional second argument specifys the number of
                        spaces to shift by (Default: 1)
  enqueue nzbfile       Add the specified NZB file to the end of the queue
  force nzbid           Force hellanzb to begin downloading the NZB with the
                        specified ID immediately, interrupting the current
                        download
  last nzbid            Move the NZB with the specified ID to the end of the
                        queue
  list [showids]        List the current queue. Specify True as the second
                        argument to include the NZB ID in the listing
  maxrate [newrate]     Return the Hellanzb.MAX_RATE (maximum download rate)
                        value. Specify a second argument to change the value --
                        a value of zero denotes no maximum rate
  move nzbid index      Move the NZB with the specified ID to the specified
                        index in the queue
  next nzbid            Move the NZB with the specified ID to the beginning of
                        the queue
  pause                 Pause downloading
  process archivedir    Post process the specified directory. The -p option is
                        preferable -- it will do this for you, or use the
                        current process if this xml rpc call fails
  shutdown              Shutdown hellanzb. Will quietly kill any post
                        processing threads that may exist
  status                Return hellanzb's current status text
  up nzbid [shift]      Move the NZB with the specified ID up in the queue. The
                        optional second argument specifys the number of spaces
                        to shift by (Default: 1)

PostProcessor:

o Multiple par2 file sets are now handled correctly (fixed)

o Added config option DELETE_PROCESSED to delete the processed sub directories
  after successful post processing

o Post processing now also occurs on sub directories (and walks down the tree
  of sub directories)

o Post processing will now be automatically resumed upon restart of hellanzb,
  if previously interrupted (such as via CTRL-C)

o Timing unrar/par2 commands

o par2 left-over repair ('.1') files now moved to PROCESSED_SUBDIR

NZBLeecher:

o Fixed bandwidth throttling to be a global value applying to all defineServer
  lines in the config file. Set the Hellanzb.MAX_RATE value to enable

o Supporting Usenet servers not requiring authorization

o Better handling of invalid groups (failed nntp GROUP commands) (thanks
  No1UKnow)

o Now overwrites (re-downloads) 0 byte files

o Fixed connect timeouts permanently killing connections (blank download status
  lines, requiring CTRL-C & restart to un-blank)

o Quicker automatic reconnections when they are lost

ArticleDecoder:

o Fixed the 0 CRC problem occurring with some files/servers (e.g.: 'CRC mismatch
  00000000 != 3B0B8959') (Thanks drak0 and Weavus)

Misc:

o Fixed darwin port unrar dependency

o Other small bug fixes/changes


v0.5:

o NZB downloader rewritten from scratch (and some pyNewsleecher code by Freddie
  <freddie@madcowdisease.org>) to use the twisted framework. With new NZB
  downloader status ticker

o Automatic reconnection and anti idle of NNTP server connections

o Bandwidth throttling 

o Can resume interrupted (CTRL-C, etc) downloads, at the segment level 

o Improved logging
