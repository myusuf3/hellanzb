hellanzb (0.11-1) experimental; urgency=low

  In previous versions, the HellaNZB XMLRPC server accepted connections from
  anywhere. Not changing the default password exposed the user to several
  security issues.

  Therefore, a new configuration directive named Hellanzb.XMLRPC_SERVER_BIND
  has been added. If it's not set, remote access to the XMLRPC server is
  disabled (bound to 127.0.0.1).

  To reproduce the same behavior as previous versions, just add
  Hellanzb.XMLRPC_SERVER_BIND = '0.0.0.0' to hellanzb.conf.

  Please add Hellanzb.XMLRPC_SERVER_BIND to your configuration file.
