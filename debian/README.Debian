HellaNZB for Debian
-------------------

The default configuration file skips unraring during post-processing 
(Hellanzb.SKIP_UNRAR is set to True). This is necessary to prevent the package
from being moved from main to contrib.

You can enable this feature again but you'll need to install the non-free
unrar package.
