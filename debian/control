Description: Newzbin (nzb) & BinNews (bns) files downloader and post-processor
 Python application designed for *nix environments that retrieves nzb files and
 fully processes them. The goal being to make getting files from Usenet as
 hands-free as possible. Once fully installed, all thats required is moving an
 nzb file to the queue directory. The rest; fetching, par-checking, un-raring,
 etc. is taken care of by hellanzb.
